            <p class="body-1">With the spring season coming to a close, it's time to shift focus to the fall season. The players listed below have impressed with their innate sense of finding the back of the net. However, with only 10 games played and many not playing all 10 it is difficult to do each player justice.</p>

            <p class="body-1 mt-3">The players listed above are based on how they performed statistically. This list might look very different if players like <b>Emery Welshman</b>, <b>Anthony Novak</b> and <b>Luis Alberto Perea</b> could stay out of the medical room.</p>

            <span class="subheading">Emery Welshman (9.0m)</span>
            <p class="body-1">Emery Welshman had his season put on hold as he travelled to the USA to participate in the Gold Cup with Guyana. Before the Gold Cup, Welshman was averaging more than a goal or assist every 2 games.</p>

            <span class="subheading">Luis Alberto Perea (8.5m)</span>
            <p class="body-1">Luis Alberto Perea sustained an arm injury and was only able to play 3 games. However, Perea was the difference in the games he played in and has been sorely missed. His impressive statline of a goal or assist every game should make Perea a fantastic option upon his return.</p>
            
            <span class="subheading">Anthony Novak (8.0m)</span>
            <p class="body-1">Anthony Novak sustained a knee injury that limited him to 5 games. However, in these 5 games Novak has scored twice. If Novak can get fit and stay healthy he might prove to be dangerous option up front.</p>
