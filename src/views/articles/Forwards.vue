          <v-card-text>
            <p> With the end of the Spring Split coming to a close soon its time to shift focus to the fall season. The list below are players that have really impressed with their fantastic scoring abilities and innate sense of finding the back of the net. Now with saying that only having 10 games and many players not playing all 10 games it will be hard to do some players justice.</p>

            <p class="mt-4"> Now the player's shown above are based on statistics only, this list would be very different if players like Anthony Novak Emery Welshman and Luis Alberto Perea were healthier and could stay out of the medical room. Now saying that we here at canplfantasy.ca have created a ones to watch in fall split essintially the players we think will perform the and get the most points. These players will be either better potentially or just as good the ones above. </p>

            <h3>Luis Alberto Perea</h3>
            <p>Luis Alberto Perea sustained an injury to the arm and only played 3 games. Perea was the difference in the games he played for Halifax and has been sorely missed. But saying that if he comes back he should go straight into your team because he scored a goal or got an assist in every game he played. </p>
          
            <h3>Emery Welshman</h3>
            <p>Emery Welshman had his season and stopped put on hold as he travelled to the USA to participate in the gold cup with Guyana before that tho he was averaging in 50% of the games he was getting a goal or assist.</p>
            
            <h3>Anthony Novak</h3>
            <p>Anthony Novak has received an injury to his knee that let him play only 5 games. But in these 5 games, he has shown an eye for goal like no other scoring 2 goals in those 5 games. Novak has averaged 57 minutes, worrying yes but if he can get fit and stay healthy they should go up and so should his goal tally.</p>
