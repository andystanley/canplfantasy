            <p class="body-1 mt-3 ">The players listed above would have scored the most fantasy points in the spring season. This list might look very different if injuries had not cut some player's season short.</p>

            <h6 class="title mb-2">Midfielders to Watch</h6>

            <span class="subheading">Michael Petrasso (8.0m)</span>
            <p class="body-1">Michael Petrasso is the penalty taker, playmaker and linchpin for Valour. Valour has not looked the same since Petrasso picked up an injury. His playmaking and scoring abilities have been missed while with Valour posting a 0-4 record without him. When healthy, Petrasso was scored 1 goal and picked up 2 assists in 4 games</p>
          
            <span class="subheading">José Escalante (7.0m)</span>
            <p class="body-1">José Escalante’s performance against Valour proved his raw talent, but consistency seems to be an issue. A new season should allow Escalante to do much better. Reasonably priced at 7.0m, he is one of the more affordable stars in the league.</p>
            
            <span class="subheading">Ryan Telfer (6.5m)</span>
            <p class="body-1"> Ryan Telfer has one of the best resumes in the CANPL, but even with that resume he has underperformed. Playing deeper in midfield has left Telfer out of his natural position. With Di Chiara coming back from injury we could potentially see Telfer moved back to where he is more comfortable. Telfer could be a bargain at 6.5m if he regains that killer instinct he had in the first game against Forge.</p>
